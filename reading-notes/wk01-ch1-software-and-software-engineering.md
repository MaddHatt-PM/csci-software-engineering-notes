# CHAPTER 1: Software and Software Engineering
## 1.1 The Nature of Software
- _Software_: 1) Instructions that provide desired features, function, and performance. 2) Data structures that enable the programs to manipulate information. 3) Information in both hard copy and virtual forms that describes the operation and use of programs.
- Software does not "wear out" physically over time in the way that hardware degrades over time. In theory, software should not fail in the long run. Software degrades due to change, either in the program itself or its environment.

### 1.2 Software Application Domains
- _System Software_: Programs that service other programs. ie: File management utilities, editors, OS, networking software
- _Application Software_: Stand-along programs that solve a business need
- _Engineering/Scientific Software_: Data science programs that process, simulate, and/or create data. ie:  Car crash simulators, consumer spending trackers
- _Embedded Software_: Software that runs in limited environments. IE: Fuel controllers for a car
- _Product-line Software_: Software composed of reusable components for limited or mass market purposes
- _Web/Mobile Applications_: Self explanatory
- _Artificial Intelligence Software_: Self explanatory

### 1.3 Legacy Software
- _Legacy Code_: Code that has declined in usage or must be re-architected to become relevant again.

## 1.2 Defining the Discipline
- _Software Engineering_: (IEEE) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.
- Software engineering layer:
    4. Tools: Automated or semi-automated support for the process and methods.
    3. Methods: Technical how-to's for building software. Soft and Hard skills.
    2. Process: A framework that must be established for effective delivery of software engineering technology.
    1. A Quality Focus: Organization commitment to quality

## 1.3 The Software Process
- _process_: a collection of activities, actions, and tasks that are performed to create a product.
- _activity_: the striving of a broad objective
- _action_: a set of tasks to accomplish a major goal
- _task_: a small, well-defined objective that produces a tangible outcome

### 1.3.1 The Process Framework
- _Process Framework_: Project Management in a meta sense. The identification of tasks and issues
    - Generic Process Framework:
        1. Communication: Identification and collaboration to understand an objective
        2. Planning: Describing of the required technical tasks, risks, resources, products-to-be-created, and work schedule
        3. Modeling: Additional planning that involves the specific details and parts
        4. Construction: Includes the generation and the testing of code
        5. Deployment: The delivery of the software (as whole or in pieces) and the recieving of feedback based on the evaluation

### 1.3.2 Umbrella Activities
- Software project tracking and control
- Risk management
- Software quality assurance
- Technical reviews
- Measurement
- Software configuration management
- Reusability management
- Work product preparation and production

### 1.3.3 Process Adaption
- When transitioning from one project to another, similar processes should be adapted to benefit the new project

## 1.4 Software Engineering Practice
## 1.4.1 The Essence of Practice
- Typical Plan
    - Understand the problem
    - Plan the solution
    - Carry out the plan
    - Examine the results

## 1.4.2 General Principle
1. The Reason It All Exists - Bring value to its users
2. Keep It Simple Stupid
3. Maintain the Vision
4. What you Produce, Others Will Consume
5. Be open to the future
6. Pla the ahead for reuse
7. Think!

## 1.5 How It All Starts
- Software developments with figuring a solution to a program
