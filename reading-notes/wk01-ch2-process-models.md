# Chapter 2: Process Models
## 2.1 A Generic Process Model
- Processes should flow from one step to another

## 2.2 Defining a Framework Activity
- Communicating with the stakeholder(s)

## 2.3 Identifying a Task Set
- Self explanatory

## 2.4 Process Assessment and Improvement
- The usage of metrics to refine future processes

## 2.5 Prescriptive Process Models
### 2.5.1 The Waterfall Model
- Linear approach to software development
- Once its released, it is difficult to fix any errors

### 2.5.2 Protyping Process Model
- Passing back of iterations of a product/feature to determine if it is sufficient
- Useful when the requirements are not fully realized at the start
- Cons:
    - Stakeholders may have incorrect ideas of the end product by seeing the inprogress version
    - The rush to a presentable state may cause bad short-term decisions to made
 
### 2.5.3 Evolutionary Process Model (Spiral Model)
- Sequential waterfall method
- Suitable for long-life products as it extends to after the product release
- May be difficult to convince customers of project stability

### 2.5.4 Unified Process Model
- Modern approach to software developments
- More incremental like the Spiral Model
- Highlights customer feedback more
- _UML_: Unified Modeling Language: Notation to quickly diagram software processes
- Steps (Multiple steps can be conducted at the same time (the core benefit of UP)):
    - Inception: communication and planning
    - Elaboration: modification of plans and modeling
    - Construction: most construction and testing
    - Transition: later construction and deployment
    - Release: release and software increment

## 2.6 Product and Process
- "If the process is bad, the product will be bad"
- Waterfall Method:
    - Pros:
        - Easy to understand and plan
        - Works for well-understood small projects
        - Analysis and testing are straightforward
    - Cons:
        - Does not accommodate change well
        - Testing occurs late in the process
        - Customer approval is at the end
- Prototyping Method:
    - Pros:
        - There is a reduced impact of requirement changes
        - The customer is involved early and often
        - It works well for small projects
        - There is a reduced likelihood of product rejection
    - Cons:
        - Customer involvement may cause delays
        - There may be temptation to release a prototype
        - Work is lost in a throwawy prototype
        - It is hard to plan and manage
- Spiral Pros
    - Pros:
        - There is continuous customer involvement
        - Development risks are managed
        - It is suitable for large, complex projects
        - It works well for extensible products
    - Cons: 
        - Risk analysis failures can doom the project
        - The project may be hard to manage
        - It requires an expert development team
- Unified Process:
    - Pros:
        - Quality documentation is emphasized
        - There is continuous customer involvement
        - It accommodates requirement changes
        - It works well for maintenance projects
    - Cons:
        - Use cases are not always precise
        - It has tricky software increment integration
        - Overlapping phases can cause problems
        - It requires an expert development team.
