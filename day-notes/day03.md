- _CRUD_: Create Read Update Delete
- _Waterfall Method_:
    - Linear workflow, good for small defined projects
    - Design entirely up front
- _Use Cases_: How the _end user_ uses the feature. Also called _User Stories_
- Larger projects may need UML maps but small projects might be overkill
- Loose Coupling Example:
    1. Classroom has AssignStudents() but is full 
    2. FullClassException is raised
    3. An indirect reference is passed along with a notification to relevant objects
- It is better to have a parent->child relationship compared to a parent<->child relationship due to garbage collection. There are better ways such as events
- Try to be as big picture as possible
- Better to have things loosely coupled to prepare for extracting out services into seperate products (rather than a rewrite)
- High Cohesion: Only house the required information
- Loose Coupling: Fewest amount of references as possible


## Current Phase: Pre-Sprint & Prototyping
- Determining Product Backlog (Requirements)

    - Database design
